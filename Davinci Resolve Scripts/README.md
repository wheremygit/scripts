# DaVinci Resolve Smart Importer for Linux

> [!NOTE]
> These scripts were inspired by [Andrew Shark's Resolve Scripts](https://gitlab.com/AndrewShark/davinci-resolve-scripts). I don't know any code nor I am a dev thus these scripts were generated using an LLM. Use at your own risk.

A pair of automation scripts for **DaVinci Resolve Studio on Linux** that fixes the infamous "silent AAC audio" issue on import as well integrates with your DE's file picker offerring seemless media importing on the Linux Desktop until [Blackmagic Fixes it themseleves](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=149142).

Instead of dealing with separate tracks or fragile GUI automation, these scripts pre-process your media files instantly using FFmpeg. They clone the video stream exactly (zero quality loss, lightning-fast) and transcode the audio to lossless **FLAC**, then inject the unified clips directly into your open Resolve project.

## Features

* **Smart Import:** Multi-select any combination of supported files (videos, audio, images). Videos are optimized on the fly; other assets are imported directly.
* **Smart Bin:** Select an entire directory. The script transcodes any video files inside it and automatically creates a matching, organized Bin (sub-folder) in your Media Pool.
* No separate audio tracks, no extra folders, and no temporary timelines.

## Script Dependencies

To run either the **Smart Import** or **Smart Bin** scripts, ensure the following packages are installed on your system.

### Arch Linux Installation

**For KDE Plasma / Qt Users:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg kdialog python

```

**For GNOME / GTK Users:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg zenity python

```

> [!NOTE]
> * **DaVinci Resolve Studio:** Blackmagic Design limits external Python scripting execution to the **Studio (paid)** version on Linux. (Typically installed via the AUR as `davinci-resolve-studio`).
> * **System GUI File Choosers:** The script dynamically checks for `zenity` or `kdialog` to open file/folder dialogs safely without blocking or crashing Resolve's interface thread.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Place the Scripts

Move the `.py` files into DaVinci Resolve's dedicated utility scripts directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility/
cp *.py ~/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility/

```

### 2. Run the Scripts in Resolve

1. Open DaVinci Resolve and open a project.
2. Navigate to the top menu: **Workspace > Scripts**.
3. Select your script to execute it.

### 3. (Optional) Assign Keyboard Shortcuts

To speed up your workflow, you can map these scripts to keyboard shortcuts:

1. Go to **DaVinci Resolve > Keyboard Customization**.
2. Search for the name of your script (under the *Application > Workspace > Scripts* category).
3. Assign your preferred shortcut key bind.
